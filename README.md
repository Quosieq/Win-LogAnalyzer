Windows log analyzer (in theory you can add error codes to other logs by adding file with all error codes to .\ErrorLib) 

Project made just for fun and trusting my capabilities in ps1

exe file already in repository, to compile itself for you after editing main ps1 file you can use IExpress, or some ps1 to exe module 

Plans for the next version: 

1. For most common codes suggest solution
2. Better readability for summary logs
